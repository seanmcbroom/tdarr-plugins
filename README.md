# Custom Tdarr Plugins

Plugins I created/modified to be used in Tdarr

## H264 AAC
I recommend adding a subtitle extractor in your stack (before this plugin) because all embedded subtitles will be removed.

## How to use

### Creating a local plugin
Go to Plugins>Creator>Create Plugin

### Edit the plugin
Go to Plugins>Local and find the plugin you just created, paste in the plugin you wish to use. It is important to change the id in the plugin to match the id for the local plugin you just created.

### Done
You should now be able to use the plugin in your stack.
